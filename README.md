# Personal File System

The Personal File System is a robust application designed to manage and organize citizen information for a large population. It leverages Docker for containerization and PostgreSQL for data storage, providing scalability, reliability, and efficiency.

## Features

- **Scalable Architecture:** Built using Docker containers, allowing for easy scaling to accommodate the needs of a population of 1 billion citizens.
- **Data Persistence:** Utilizes PostgreSQL database for persistent storage of citizen information, ensuring data integrity and reliability.
- **Secure Access:** Implements security best practices to protect citizen data and prevent unauthorized access.
- **Backup and Recovery:** Includes a backup strategy for the PostgreSQL database to prevent data loss and ensure recoverability.
- **Compliance:** Designed with regulatory compliance in mind, ensuring adherence to relevant data protection laws and regulations.
- **Monitoring and Maintenance:** Incorporates monitoring and logging functionality to track system performance and detect any issues, along with documentation and maintenance procedures for ease of management.
